 Steps to Build the Project:
    • Step 1: Set Up an AWS Account
    • Step 2: Create two S3 Buckets (Source S3 Bucket Name: amc-polly-source-bucket, Destination S3 Bucket Name: amc-polly-destination-bucket)
    • Step 3: Create an IAM Policy (IAM Policy Name: amc-polly-lambda-policy)
Policy Defination:

- {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
      {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "s3:GetObject",
              "s3:PutObject"
          ],
          "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::amc-polly-source-bucket/*",
              "arn:aws:s3:::amc-polly-destination-bucket/*"
          ]
      },
      {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "polly:SynthesizeSpeech"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
      }
  ]
}


    • Step 4: Create an IAM Role (IAM Role Name: amc-polly-lambda-role) and attach amc-polly-lambda-policy and AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole Policies
    • Step 5: Create and Configure the Lambda Function (Lambda Function Name: TextToSpeechFunction)
        ◦ Set the runtime to Python 3.8.
        ◦ Set the execution role with necessary permissions for S3 and Polly. (Step 4)
        ◦ Add Environment Variables (SOURCE_BUCKET: Name of your source S3 bucket and DESTINATION_BUCKET: Name of your destination S3 bucket.
    • Step 6: Configure S3 Event Notification
        ◦ Set up an event notification in the source S3 bucket to trigger the Lambda function on new object creation events with the .txt suffix.
    • Step 7: Write Lambda Function Code
    • Step 8: Test the System
